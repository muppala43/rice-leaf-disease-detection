# 🌾 Rice Leaf Disease Detection using Deep Learning

This project was developed by **Dillip Muppala** as part of my Data Science learning journey. It focuses on identifying and classifying three common rice plant diseases using image data and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

---

## 🔍 Objective

The goal is to create a deep learning model that can accurately classify rice leaf diseases into the following categories:

- ✅ Bacterial Leaf Blight  
- ✅ Brown Spot  
- ✅ Leaf Smut

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset contains **120 high-resolution images**, divided equally among three classes (approximately 40 per class).  
Each image is around **897 × 3081** pixels in size.

> 🗂️ Note: Due to file size, the dataset is not included in this repo.  
You can download it from your Google Drive or [external source if shared].
